# 1. Replay Memory
# For this, weâ€™re going to need two classses:
# - Transition - a named tuple representing a single transition in our environment.
# It essentially maps (state, action) pairs to their (next_state, reward) result,
# with the state being the screen difference image as described later on.
# - ReplayMemory - a cyclic buffer of bounded size that holds the transitions observed recently.
# It also implements a .sample() method for selecting a random batch of transitions for training.
